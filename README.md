# Pump and Probe Measurement for Transient Absorption Spectroscopy 

Pure Python implementation of pump and probe data acquisition program. Integrated Newport delay line, Horiba CCD, SR830 Lockin dual lock in amplifier and Ti:Sa tunable Laser.

Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), belonging to a ultrafast spectroscopy family, is a pump-probe technique that measures changes in a sample's absorption after it's excited by a ultra fast light pulse (the "pump"), using a second, delayed light pulse (the "probe") to monitor the evolution of transient species. The second pulse servers as a optical probe. By changing de optical delay line, the probe can sweep in your interest time window. This python implementation intend to give a user friendly experience to operating this measurement. Many features have been considered, such as calibrate the zero delay line, remote control lock in system sensitivity, choose lock in channels, real time data visulization, and data saving.

Data reading system can be a single photodetector to a well calibrated CCD camera. More functions will come as requested.

## Installation
pip install PyQt5<br>
pip install pyqtgraph<br>
pip install numpy<br>

## How to use
The main program is pump_probe_pc_main.py. Before running the program, please make sure you have all hardware driver properly instally and cables plugged.<br><br>
The ui_pump_probe.py is an GUI file generated by pyqt.<br> 
The pump_probe_pc_panel.py includes ui_pump_probe file and neccessary hook functions.<br>
The C633.py file is customerized package for communicating with PI linear delay stage through pyvisa package.
The SR830.py file is customerized package for communicating with Standford Instrument SR830 lock in amplifier.
The Horiba_DNFActivateX.py is commerical package from Horiba to communicating with their CCD and spectrograph device.<br><br>
Users need to modify those file in order to couple into their hardware system.
